# Kitara FC - SUMO Hackathon
Note that majority of "stolen_code" is the neural network taken from the following repository (LICENSE included in folder):

https://github.com/atulapra/Emotion-detection

For Judges:
- temp.py was just a testing file so can ignore
- our code is written in stolen_code/src/runner.py
  - half of this is from the model and the other half is our own code (emotions.py is from the repository)
- visual prompts are in stolen_code/src/img
  - on their side due to orientation of raspberry pi display in recorded demonstration
